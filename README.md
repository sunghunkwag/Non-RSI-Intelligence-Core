# Non-RSI Intelligence Core

A minimal implementation of the "Path B x C" AGI architecture hypothesis.

*   **Objective**: Demonstrate system-level acceleration typically associated with "singularity" scenarios without modifying the source code (Non-RSI).
*   **Mechanism**: Combines fixed-architecture agents (World Model + Planner) with a collective orchestration layer (Shared Memory + Project Graph + Skill Synthesis).
*   **Core Logic**: Agents evolve internal parameters and accumulate tools/knowledge artifacts, while the system optimizes resource allocation and organizational policy.
*   **File**: `NON_RSI_AGI_CORE_v2.py` - Single-file Python implementation with no external dependencies.
